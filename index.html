    <p><strong><em>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
        specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
         electronic typesetting,</strong></em></p><hr>
         <p> remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
            the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
             and more recently with desktop publishing software like <br><br>Aldus PageMaker
              including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
